# Capstone 2 Project

- Use the `kmeans` function to cluster movies by rating and domestic gross revenue. Use the `broom` package
to tidy the result of using `kmeans` and incorprate this
into your analysis script

- Use ggplot2 to make the domestic gross vs. rating scatter plot. Use color to encode the result of the kmeans algorithm.

- Annotate the plot with movie titles

- Add a regression analysis of revenue vs. rating to address the question "do movies with high ratings tend to have bigger revenues"?
