# Publishing Analyses with R

Rstudio has created an impressive eco-system for publishing
with R. It has concentrated around two systems: Rmarkdown for 
creating documents that include both text and data analysis code, publishable in multiple formats, and shiny, a framework for creating interactive html applications that allow users to explore
data analyses.

## RMarkdown

Rstudio has provided substantial tutorials and documentation
for Rmarkdown: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

We will go over parts of the tutorial included there: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

and create an HTML report of the movie analysis we have been
working on.

## Shiny

Like RMarkdown, Rstudio provides great tutorials and documentation
for shiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com/

We will go over parts of the shiny tutorial: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/

We will create an application for our movie analysis as an example.
