# Text analysis

In this section we will learn about text analysis using R and the tidy data framework. We will be using the `tidytext` package, and material from the excellent textbook "Text Mining with R": http://tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html. Specifically, we will work through the first two chapters of the book "The tidy text format" and
"Sentiment analysis with tidy data". You can use the notes from the link above.
