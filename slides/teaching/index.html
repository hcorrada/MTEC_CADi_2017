# Teaching with R

The publishing and sharing capabilities provided by R
and Rstudio are outstanding resources for teaching with
and about R.

---

## Course materials

Using Rmarkdown as the main authoring tool for course
materials has several advantages:

- Text discussing analyses, including plots and results,
exists in the same document containing code to perform analysis.

- Analyses are reproducible since documents are executable

- Students can interact with teaching materials by downloading
and re-executing or modifying analysis code

---

## Course materials

- Can create lecture notes and slides, reusing code and text

- Can use bookdown https://bookdown.org/ to create lecture note
collection publishable in different formats 

- Placing materials in github https://github.com makes it possible
for students to download and modify materials. Can also incorporate
feedback and modifications from others.

---

## Assignments

- Students can submit Rmarkdown (or rendered Rmarkdown) for
assignments to include both code used in analysis and text
discussing analyses.

- Assignments can be handed out in Rmarkdown asking both conceptual and analysis questions. Students can write text 
(with mathematical notation if necessary) for the former, 
and R code for the latter.

---

## Free and open source

- R and Rstudio are free and open source and remain so after students are done with courses. 

- Many commercial products are free to use for student use, but must be purchased after students are done. 

- This can be limiting for many students, especially those working in subject areas where purchasing expensive software is not a priority

---

## Wide range of activities

- Besides allowing students to interact with code, using shiny as a teaching
tool can be very powerful.

- Students often find creating interactive applications rewarding

- Wide range of analysis tools, covering many subject areas, or covering
many technologies, allow students to carry out activities they find
specifically motivating and interesting.
