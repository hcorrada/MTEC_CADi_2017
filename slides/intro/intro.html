## What is Data Science?

Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to create data-centric artifacts and applications that address specific scientific, socio-political, business, or other questions.

---

### Data

Measureable units of information gathered or captured from activity of people, places and things.

### Specific Questions

Seeking to understand a phenomenon, natural, social or other, can we formulate specific questions for which an answer posed in terms of patterns observed, tested and or modeled in data is appropriate.

### Interdisciplinary Activities

- Formulating a question, assessing the appropriateness of the data and findings used to find an answer require understanding of the specific subject area. 
- Deciding on the appropriateness of models and inferences made from models based on the data at hand requires understanding of statistical and computational methods.

---

### Data-centric artifacts and applications

- Answers to questions derived from data are usually shared and published in meaningful, succint but sufficient, reproducible artifacts (papers, books, movies, comics). 

- Going a step further, interactive applications that let others explore data, models and inferences are great.

## Why Data Science?

The granularity, size and accessibility data, comprising both physical, social, commercial and political spheres has exploded in the last decade or more. 

&gt; I keep saying that the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians”

&gt; Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html?_r=0)

## Why Data Science?

&gt; “The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids.”

&gt; “Because now we really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand that data and extract value from it.”

&gt; Hal Varian

## Data Science in Humanities and Social Sciences

Because of the large amount of data produced across many
spheres of human social and creative activity, many questions in the humanities and social sciences may be addressed by characterizing patterns in data. 

---

## Data Science in Humanities and Social Sciences

In the humanities, this can range from unproblematic questions:

- how to dissect a large creative corpora, say music, literature, based on raw characteristics of those works, text, sound and image. 

To more problematic questions

- analysis of intent, understanding, appreciation and valuation of these creative corpora.

---

## Data Science in Humanities and Social Sciences

In the social sciences, issues of fairness and transparency in the current era of big data are especially problematic. 

- Is data collected representative of population for which inferences are drawn? 

- Are methods employed learning latent unfair factors from ostensibly fair data? 

- These are issues that the research community is now starting to address.

---

## Data Science in Humanities and Social Sciences

In all settings, issues of ethical collection of data, application of models, and deployment of data-centric artifacts are essential to grapple with. 

Issues of privacy are equally important.

---

## Course organization

This course will cover basics of how to use the R data analysis environment for data science activities in humanities and social science. 

---

### Day 1: Introduction and preparation

- Get ourselved settled with R
- Formulating a question that can be addressed with data
- How to get data to address a specific question
- How to manipulate this data to get to what we need for our question of interest
- How to visualize this data 

---

### Day 2: Use cases

- Social media analysis: text and network structures
- Fitting and evaluating regression models in R
- Text analysis
- Machine Learning modeling in R
- Survey analysis 
- Nested models in R

---

### Day 3: Presentation and teaching

- How to present and publish analysis using R
- Using R in teaching

---

## General Workflow

---

### Defining the goal

- What is the question/problem?
- Who wants to answer/solve it?
- What do they know/do now?
- How well can we expect to answer/solve it?
- How well do they want us to answer/solve it?

---

### Data collection and Management

- What data is available?
- Is it good enough?
- Is it enough?
- What are sensible measurements to derive from this data?
  Units, transformations, rates, ratios, etc.

---

### Modeling

- What kind of problem is it?
  E.g., classification, clustering, regression, etc.
- What kind of model should I use?
- Do I have enough data for it?
- Does it really answer the question?

---

### Model evaluation

- Did it work? How well?
- Can I interpret the model?
- What have I learned?

---

### Presentation

- Again, what are the measurements that tell the real story?
- How can I describe and visualize them effectively?

---

### Deployment

- Where will it be hosted? 
- Who will use it?
- Who will maintain it?
